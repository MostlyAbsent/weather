A simple weather app for Western Australia

# Introduction

This is a simple web app to add to my portfolio, focused on Western Australia and using the public data from the Bureau Of Meteorology. They provide their data as xml files accessible from ftp, broadly this project will likely include a simple web router, a UI to select a location and show the forecast from the data set, and lastly a system to routinely update our known data.
